How—how fortunate I am
That I have found you here in my life
Love that we have cared and
All good times that we shared
//All because of you, because of you
Miss—I miss you all this time
I just wish that you were by my side
’cause what we have been through
/Separated you away
But in my heart all these moments stay
Revolvin’ around, spinnin’ around
Time is never gonna wait for anyone
Despite how far
I’ll wait for you
And I will say I
Love you everyday
Love you evermore
Wish you’re stayin’ with me here, always
’cause I still love you everyday
And miss you every night
Wish you’d know I love
you ’til the end of time
Wanna say I
Love you, Love you
Love you, Love you
But now I only can
Dream of you alone
